## myPI Face ID Access Control System
The key aspect of this project is to develop on a Raspberry Pi to implement a Face ID system for unlocking doors in schools and companies. It can replace the ID cards, which are always forgotten or stolen from the owner. It is based on OpenCV, which is powerful at real-time computer vision and free to use.

## Devices Used
Raspberry Pi Zero W          x1
OV5647 Mini Camera Module    x1
Red LED & Green LED 
Resistors

## Install
Here are the libraries need to be install for the project:


## raspi app for face recognitin 
The premise of facial recognition is to identify the resence of a face in the image or video frame which is done with Haar Cascade Algorithm. 
The code for recognising faces can be devided into three parts, data gathering, train the recognizer and recognition.

## vue website application
The Web application can communication with the Raspberry Pi board by http protocol. The board will transmit the message that contains the time, ID and image of visitors. The information will be used for recording in database and representing on the web page. 

## Server and Database

## Flask local control application
